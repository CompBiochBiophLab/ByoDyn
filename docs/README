On this directory you will find four documentation files: an installation guide, a tutorial and quickstart guide, a user reference manual and the API.
Those files are in ".tex" format or not been generated yet, in order to build the pdf files (and html for the API), execute the corresponding script "createDocumentation".
At any case, although older than the tex files here, you can find already built pdf files at SourceForge.net site.
